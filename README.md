Course Goals and Objectives
Programming is the art of explaining to a computer what you want it to do, in exact detail and in a language that the computer can understand. Programming is only one part of computer science, but it is the most basic and most central part. It is an activity that requires you to think logically, to solve problems, to express yourself clearly, and often to endure a certain amount of frustration as you try to get your programs to work. The result, though, can be very rewarding. 

In this course, you will learn and use the Java programming language. Java was introduced in 1995. In the years since then, it has become one of the most important languages for real application development. It is a very versatile language. Java can be used to write regular desktop applications. Many complex interactive Web sites are written using Java on the Web server. And, it can be used to write applications for many types of mobile phones. Even high-performance scientific programming has been done in Java. It can also be used to write ªapplets,ª which are small programs that appear on web pages, but that use has become much less common than it was when Java was first introduced. Java has also become perhaps the most popular language for teaching programming.

This course will be focused on the training of the students so that they would be proficient in Java Programming. Therefore, the grade will be given based on how well the students are at Java programming for any given problems.
